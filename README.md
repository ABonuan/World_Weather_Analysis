# World_Weather_Analysis
Predict the best time of year for cities for people to plan their vacation

## Primary Purpose
The purpose of this analysis is to collect and present data from customers via the search page, which they will filter with their preferred travel criteria in order to find their ideal hotel anywhere in the world.  The input from the customer is their ideal minimum and maximum temperature.  The results will be a map of possible options for cities and hotels.

## Secondary Purpose
During this project, we were asked to put a project together to help students explore how to determine correlations between weather data, maximum temperature, percent humidity, percent cloudiness & wind speed specifically, and latitude.  The linear regression was calculated for each parameter against the latitude.  The results show that only the maximum temperature has a strong correlation with the latitude of a location.  The closer one gets to the equator, the higher the maximum temperature.  Percent Humidity, percent cloudiness and wind speed have a low correlation with the latitude because of the everchanging weather patterns that affect each weather parameter.

See examples of the linear regression plots for the Northern Hemisphere below.
